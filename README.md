Retail Customer Behavior Analysis Using K-Means Clustering


This repository provides an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze and segment retail customer behavior effectively. By clustering data based on customer purchasing patterns, this project enables businesses to gain valuable insights into their customer base.

📊 Features
The analysis focuses on clustering customers using two critical attributes:

Total_Items: The number of items purchased by a customer.

Total_Cost: The total expenditure of the customer.

These features are essential in identifying patterns and behaviors in customer spending and purchasing frequency.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed transactional information. It has been preprocessed and formatted for use with the K-Means clustering algorithm.
